# Video_Games_Sales_Analysis
Sales performance analysis identifies the difference between desired and actual performance. Understanding the different enhances employee handling and morale. In this project, my teammate and I are exploring the Video Games Sales Dataset from Kaggle to analyse the sales performance of video games at 22 Dec 2016. 

**Business Question:**
- What is the most preferred platform, genre and games in each country?
- How is the sales performance?
- Will the sales performance affected by the aggregate score compiled by Metacritic staff and 
score by Metacritic's subscribers?
